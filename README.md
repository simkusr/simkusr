## About Me üßë‚Äçüíª

I build **high-performance backend systems**, design **cloud infrastructure**, and automate deployment pipelines. While **Go** is my primary language, I also use **Python** for scripting, tooling, and rapid prototyping.

I focus on building **high-performance backend systems in Go**, using Python as a secondary tool for scripting and prototyping.  
While my current work and expertise are fully dedicated to cloud-native applications and automation, I am gradually exploring **systems programming and Linux kernel development** as a long-term aspiration to expand my skills in low-level programming with C.
