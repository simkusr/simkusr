## About Me üßë‚Äçüíª

I design and build **high-performance backend systems** with Go, automate deployment pipelines, and manage **cloud-native infrastructure**.  
While **Golang** is my primary language, I also use **Python** for scripting, tooling, and quick prototyping.  

My day-to-day work is focused on **scalable backend services** and **automation in cloud environments**, while I‚Äôm also continuously learning and gradually exploring **systems programming and Linux kernel development** to deepen my expertise in low-level performance and optimization.
