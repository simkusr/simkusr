# Hello there 👋

As you camed accross my GitHub profile, I will try to give you a short introduction about me and what I'm doing here on GitHub.


## About me

I'm a self thought [Python](https://www.python.org/) codecrafter working hard to gain as much experience with `Python` and it's eco system as I can. It involves not only coding using Python language but also working hard to develop a solid infrastructure using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) scripts to prepare and deploy sollutions to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). Also while working on different [Cloud Service Providers](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-are-cloud-providers) like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) I know how easily and fast any size of application can be published to the [www](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web).
