# Hello there 👋

As you came across my GitHub profile, I will try to give you a short introduction about me and what I'm doing here on GitHub.

## About me

I'm a self thought [Python](https://www.python.org/) codecrafter working hard to gain as much experience with `Python` and it's eco system as I can. It involves not only coding using Python language but also working hard to develop a solid infrastructure using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) scripts to prepare and deploy sollutions to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). Also while working on different [Cloud Service Providers](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-are-cloud-providers) like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) I know how easily and fast any size of application can be published to the [www](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web).

### A Short summary of my tools that I use daily
- ⚙️ Daily using `.py`, `.sh`, `.tf`, `.json`, `.yml`, `git`
- 📦 Working daily with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/), [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/), [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/), [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/), [Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- ☁️ Experience working with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) scripts to prepare infrastructure
- ⛏️ Creating CI/CD pipelines with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and [GitLab CI/CD pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/)
